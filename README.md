# Spurs Center

This application allows users to see the San Antonio Spurs schedule. 
This web page also provides functionality to a list of administrators for the site. 
Admins have the ability to add new games, modify old games, delete games, and add additional administrators.
The web page also includes use of the Google maps API to show the loctaion of the home game center.

## Structure

I built this application as part of a semester long project. I used the Angular2 starter kit provided by Miguel Angulo. The starter kit consists of a 
Python backend, and CSS, HTML, and Typescript frontend. Additionally, I used Javascript and JQuery in small intervals for the project. 
Prior to this project, I had never written code in Python, CSS, Typescript, Javascript, or JQuery and had very limited experience in HTML. 

This project is also my first time using Angular2, and Bootstrap. Throughout this project, I was able to learn a variety of things with 
these two frameworks including, but not limited to, creating dropdowns, navigation bars, modifying backgrounds, adding images, and much more. 

For this project, I am also using Heroku for the first time. I have synced the GitHub and Heroku projects so any changes pushed to GitHub 
will automatically update the Heroku application. You can view and use the application on Heroku using the following link: [SpursApp](https://spursapp.herokuapp.com/)

## Initial Admin Login

I have created an initial Admin for you to log in with. The details for that profile are listed below. 
Once you have logged in with this profile, you are able to create additional admins, add games, edit games, and delete games.
