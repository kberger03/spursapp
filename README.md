This web page also provides functionality to a list of administrators for the site. 
Admins have the ability to add new games, modify old games, delete games, and add additional administrators.
The web page also includes use of the Google maps API to show the loctaion of the home game center.  

I built this application as part of a semester long project.  
I used the starter kit provided by Miguel Angulo. The starter kit consists of a 
Python backend, and CSS, HTML, and Typescript frontend.  Additionally, I used Javascript and JQuery in small intervals for the project. 
Prior to this project, I had never written code in Python, CSS, Typescript, Javascript, or JQuery and had very limited experience in HTML. 

For this project, I am also using Heroku for the first time.  I have synced the GitHub and Heroku projects so any changes pushed to GitHub 
will automatically update the Heroku application.  You can view and use the application on Heroku using the following link: [SpursApp](https://spursapp.herokuapp.com/)
